\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{ids}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the IDs
of the image annotations of interest. If numeric, the image annotations are picked by number.
If \code{NULL}, all image annotations are included - subsequent selection with \code{tags} and
\code{test} is possible.}

\item{tags}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, the tags for the image annotation
selection. See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{test}{Character value. One of \emph{any}. \emph{all}, \emph{identical}, \emph{not_identical} and
\emph{none}. Specifies how input for \code{tags} is used to select image annotations.
See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{expand}{Specifies image expansion. An image that is cropped based on an image
annotation centers around the image annotation. If \code{expand = 0}, the default, the dimensions of the image,
that is width/x-axis and height/y-axis, are set to include only the image annotation area
and nothing more. Using \code{expand}, the cropped image section can be adjusted. See section
\emph{Expansion of cropped image sections} for more information.}

\item{square}{Logical value. Most image annotations come in variable shapes and
have different horizontal and vertical diameters. Therefore, height and width of the image
section are usually not equal. If \code{square = TRUE}, the cropped section of the image that
contains the annotated structure is forced into a square: the bigger diameter of both is taken
as default. E.g. if the horizontal diameter of the image annotation is 1mm and the
vertical diameter is 1.5mm, the output image will have height and width of 1.5mm. That is,
in terms of coordinates, an x-range and a y-range of 1.5mm.

Processing of the image output depending on argument \code{expand} happens afterwards.}

\item{encircle}{Logical value. If TRUE, a polygon is drawn around the
exact extent of the annotated structure encircled drawn in \code{createImageAnnotations()}.}

\item{inner}{Logical value. Only applies if an image annotation contains a secondary image annotation within its own area. If \code{FALSE}, the inner borders of the image annotation
are not included in the output.}

\item{unit}{Character value. The unit in which the x- and y-axis text
are displayed. Use \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{round}{Numeric value or \code{FALSE}. If numeric and \code{unit} is not \emph{px}, rounds
axes text.}

\item{line_color}{Character. Affects color of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_size}{Numeric. Affects size of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_type}{Character. The line type. One of \emph{'blank'}, \emph{'solid'},
\emph{'dashed'}, \emph{'dotted'}, \emph{'dotdash'}, \emph{'longdash'} and \emph{'twodash'}.}

\item{sb_dist}{Distance measure or \code{FALSE}. If distance measure,
defines the distance in SI units that a scale bar illustrates.
Scale bar is plotted with \code{ggpLayerScaleBarSI()}. If \code{FALSE},
no scale bar is plotted.}

\item{display_title}{Logical value. If TRUE, the number of each image annotation
is plotted in the title.}

\item{display_subtitle}{Logical value. If TRUE, the ID of each image annotation
is plotted in the subtitle.}

\item{display_caption}{Logial value. If TRUE, the tags of each image annotation
are plotted in the caption.}

\item{ggpLayers}{List of \code{ggproto}-objects that are added to each plot.
Skim \code{ggpLayer*()}-functions for more options.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Numeric values or NULL. Used to arrange multiple plots.}

\item{plot}{Logical value. If TRUE, the plots are plotted immediately
via \code{gridExtra.grid.arrange()} and the list of plots is returned
invisibly. Else the list of plots is simply returned.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{ggpLayerScaleBarSI()} if input for
\code{sb_dist} is a valid distance measure. Exception: \code{xrange} and \code{yrange} are
set to the ranges of the image that was cropped to display the image annotation.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplots. Each slot contains a plot
that visualizes an image annotation.
}
\description{
Plots structures and areas that were annotated with \code{createImageAnnotations()}.
}
\details{
At first, the image section that contains the image annotation is
cropped such that it only contains the extent of the polygon that represents
the borders of the annotation (ranges can be obtained with \code{getImageAnnotatationRange()}).
Using arguments \code{square} and \code{expand} can be used to expand the displayed
image section individually.
}
\section{Distance measures}{


Several functions in \code{SPATA2} have arguments that take \emph{distance input}.
To specifically refer to a distance the unit must be specified. There are
three ways to create valid input for these arguments.

\strong{1. In pixel:}

There are two valid input options to specify the distance in pixel:

\itemize{
\item{numeric:}{ Single numeric values, e.g. \code{arg_input = c(2, 3.554, 69, 100.67)}. If no unit
is specified the input will be interpreted as pixels.}
\item{character:}{ Suffixed with \emph{'px'}, e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2px', '3.554px', '69px', '100.67px')}}
}

Note: The unit pixel (px) is used for distances as well as for areas. If pixel
refers to a distance the pixel side length is meant. If pixel refers to an area the
number of pixels is meant.

\strong{2. According to the Systeme international d`unites (SI):}

Specifying distances in SI units e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2mm', '4mm')} etc.
requires the input to be a character as the unit must be provided as suffix.
Between the numeric value and the unit must be no empty space! Valid suffixes
can be obtained using the function \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()}.

\strong{3. As vectors of class \code{unit}:}

Behind the scenes \code{SPATA2} works with the \code{units} package. Input
is converted into vectors of class \code{units}. Therefore, input can be directly
provided this way: \code{arg_input = units::set_unit(x = c(2,4), value = 'mm')}
Note that \emph{pixel} is not a valid unit in the \code{units} package. If you want
to specify the input in pixel you have to use input option 1. In pixel.
}

\section{Expansion of cropped image sections}{


The argument \code{expand} is a versatile way, to specify how a cropped
image section is extracted. If you want the cropped image as is, specify
\code{expand = 0}. Else, there are multiple options. In general, \code{expand} takes
three kinds of values, namely percentages, distances and distance exclamations.

\itemize{
\item{Percentage:}{ A string suffixed with \emph{\%}. E.g. \code{expand = '50\%'}
adds 50\% of the distance from the center to the border of the image annotation
to the image frame.}
\item{Distance measures:}{ In pixel or European units of length. E.g. \code{expand =  list(x = '1mm')}
expands the x-axis on both sides with 1mm. \verb{expand = list(x = c('0.5mm', 1.5mm')}
expands the x-axis on the left side with 0.5mm and on the right side with 1.5mm.}
\item{Exclam distance measures:}{ Distance measure with an exclamation mark
suffix. E.g. \code{expand = '1mm!'} centers the image and forces an axis length of
1 millimeter. (Example 5) }
}

Depending on how the values are specified different parts of the image can be
expanded.

Single values, like \code{expand = 50}, are recycled: Every end of each image axis
is expanded by 50 pixel. (Example 2)

Vectors of length two, like \code{expand = c('1mm', '2mm')}, are recycled: The beginning
of each axis is expanded by 1 millimeter. The end of each axis is expanded by
2mm. (Example 3)

Named lists can be more precise. \code{expand = list(x = c('1mm', '0.5mm'), y = c('0.25mm', '1mm'))}.
Applies the vectors to expand the corresponding axis. (Example 4)

Using exclam input the side of the axis must not be specified as the
axis is fixed as a whole. E.g \code{expand = list(x = '1mm!', y = '2mm!')} results
in the same output as \verb{expand = list(x = c('1mm!', '1mm!'), y = c('2mm!', '2mm!')}.
}

\section{Selection of image annotations with tags}{


Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
\enumerate{
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{not_identical} or \emph{4}: To be included, an image
annotation must \strong{not} be tagged with the combination of input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'none'} or \emph{5}: To be included, an image annotation
must \strong{not} contain any of the input tags.
}

Note that the filtering process happens after the filtering by input for argument
\code{ids}. You can first select a group of image annotations by naming their IDs
and then select among them via tags and test. If \code{ids} is \code{NULL}, you select
among all image annotations via tags and test. And if \code{tags} is also \code{NULL},
the function uses all image annoations.
