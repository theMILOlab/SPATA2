\arguments{
\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{ids}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the IDs
of the image annotations of interest. If numeric, the image annotations are picked by number.
If \code{NULL}, all image annotations are included - subsequent selection with \code{tags} and
\code{test} is possible.}

\item{tags}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, the tags for the image annotation
selection. See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{test}{Character value. One of \emph{any}. \emph{all}, \emph{identical}, \emph{not_identical} and
\emph{none}. Specifies how input for \code{tags} is used to select image annotations.
See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{outer}{Logical value. Only applies if an image annotation contains a secondary image annotation within its own area. If \code{FALSE}, the outer border of the image annotation
is not included in the output.}

\item{inner}{Logical value. Only applies if an image annotation contains a secondary image annotation within its own area. If \code{FALSE}, the inner borders of the image annotation
are not included in the output.}
}
\value{
A data.frame that contains variables \emph{id}, \emph{border},
and the numeric variables \emph{x}, \emph{y} and \emph{tags}.
}
\description{
Extracts the coordinates of the vertices polygons that represent
the borders of the image annotation.
}
\details{
The variables \emph{x} and \emph{y} give the position of the vertices of the polygon
that was drawn to encircle the structure \code{createImageAnnotations()}. These vertices correspond
to the border of the annotation.
}
\section{Selection of image annotations with tags}{


Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
\enumerate{
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{not_identical} or \emph{4}: To be included, an image
annotation must \strong{not} be tagged with the combination of input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'none'} or \emph{5}: To be included, an image annotation
must \strong{not} contain any of the input tags.
}

Note that the filtering process happens after the filtering by input for argument
\code{ids}. You can first select a group of image annotations by naming their IDs
and then select among them via tags and test. If \code{ids} is \code{NULL}, you select
among all image annotations via tags and test. And if \code{tags} is also \code{NULL},
the function uses all image annoations.
