\title{Buffer area}
\usage{
buffer_area(df, buffer, close_plg = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data.frame with variables \emph{x} and \emph{y} describing the
vertices of the polygon that encircles the area based on which the barcode-spots
are binned. E.g. slot @area of \code{ImageAnnotation}-objects. Note that the order of
observations in the data.frame must correspond to the order of vertices
of the polygon.}

\item{buffer}{The distance by which to consecutively expand the
area that covers the image annotation screening. Given to argument
\code{dist} of function \code{sf::st_buffer()}.}
}
\description{
Buffers the area of a polygon.
}
\examples{

 library(ggplot2)

 object <- downloadSpataObject("313_T")

 object <- setImageAnnotation(object, img_ann = image_annotations[["313_T"]][["necrotic_center"]])

 outline1 <- getImgAnnOutlineDf(object, ids = "necrotic_center")

 print(outline1)

 outline2 <- buffer_area(outline1, buffer = 20)

 print(outline2)

 plotSurface(object) +
  geom_polygon(data = outline1, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), color = "black", fill = NA, size = 2) +
  geom_polygon(data = outline2, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red" , fill = NA, size = 2)
