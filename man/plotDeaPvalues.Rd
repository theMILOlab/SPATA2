\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{across}{Character value or NULL. Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingOptions()} to obtain all variable names that group the
barcode spots of your object in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the particular groups
of interest the grouping variable specified in argument \code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{relevel}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the input order of \code{across_subset}
determines the order in which the groups of interest are displayed. Groups that
are not included are dropped which affects the colors with which they are displayed.}

\item{method_de}{Character value. Denotes the method to according to which the de-analysis is performed.
Given to argument \code{test.use} of the \code{Seurat::FindAllMarkers()}-function. Run \code{SPATA::dea_methods}
to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{max_adj_pval}{Numeric value. Sets the threshold for adjusted p-values. All genes
with adjusted p-values above that threshold are ignored.}

\item{binwidth}{Numeric value. Denotes the binwidth to use for the histogram.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{plot_type}{Character value. Specifies the type of plot to use to
visualize the results. If valid input options are not mentioned in the
description use \code{validPlotTypess()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{limits_x}{Numeric vector of length two. Specify the limits
of the x-axis.}

\item{display_title}{Logical value. If set to TRUE an informative title is displayed.}

\item{of_sample}{This argument is currently inactive. It might be reactivated when
spata-objects can store more than one sample.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot-object that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.
}
\description{
Use argument \code{across} to specify the grouping
variable of interest across which the de-analysis has been conducted.

Valid input options for \code{plot_type} are \emph{'density'} and
\emph{'histogram'}.
