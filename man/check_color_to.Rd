check_color_to(

  color_by,
  all_features = character(),

  max_length = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{color_by}{The variable to be displayed by color:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene set} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} as a character vector. If more than one gene is specified the average
expression of those genes will be calculated and displayed. Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Feature} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getFeaturenNames()}}
}}

\item{all_features}{The valid features specified as a character vector.}

\item{all_gene_sets}{The valid gene sets specified as a character vector.}

\item{all_genes}{The valid genes specified as a character vector.}
}
\description{
A member of the \code{adjusting-check_()}-family. Takes a character
vector and sorts its elements into a list depending on whether it was found in
the input of \code{all_features}, \code{all_genes} or \code{all_gene_sets}.

Returns a list with one slot named \emph{features}, \emph{genes} or \emph{gene_sets}
containing the respective found/valid input of \code{color_to}.
