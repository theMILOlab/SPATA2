\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. All numeric variables (meaning genes,
gene-sets and numeric features) that are supposed to be included in
the screening process.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
image annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value or vector of length 2. Specifies how many times the area is buffered with the value
denoted in \code{binwidth}.
(See details for more.)}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the circular bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = getCCD(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the image annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{arrange_rows}{Alter the way the rows of the heatmap
are displayed in order to highlight patterns. Currently either \emph{'maxima'},
\emph{'minima'} or \emph{'input'}. If \emph{'input'}, variables are displayed
in the same order as they are provided in the argument \code{variables}.}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{multiplier}{Numeric value. For better visualization the transient pattern
is smoothed with a loess fit. The total number of predicted values (via \code{stats::predict()})
is the number of bins multiplied with the input for this argument.}

\item{clrsp}{Character value. Specifies the color spectrum to be used to represent
continuous values of numeric variables. Run \code{validColorSpectra()} to obtain
valid input options.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Either \emph{'mean'} or \emph{'median'}.
Specifies the function with which the bins are summarized.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Additional parameters given to \code{pheatmap::pheatmap()}. If argument
\code{with_ggplot} is TRUE given to \code{scale_color_add_on()}.}

\description{
Plots gene expression changes against the distance

\details{
In conjunction with argument \code{id} which provides the
ID of the image annotation of interest the arguments \code{distance},
\code{binwidth}, \code{n_bins_circle}, \code{angle_span} and \code{n_bins_angle} can be used
to specify the exact area that is screened as well as the resolution of the screening.

\bold{How the algorithm works:} During the IAS-algorithm the barcode spots are
binned according to their localisation to the image annotation. Every bin's mean
expression of a given gene is then aligned in an ascending order - mean expression
of bin 1, mean expression of bin 2, ... up to the last bin, the bin with the
barcode-spots that lie farest away from the image annotation. This allows to infer
the gene expression changes in relation to the image annotation and
to screen for genes whose expression changes resemble specific biological
behaviors. E.g. linear ascending: gene expression increases linearly with
the distance to the image annotation. E.g. immediate descending: gene expression
is high in close proximity to the image annotation and declines logarithmically
with the distance to the image annotation.

\bold{How circular binning works:}
To bin barcode-spots according to their localisation to the image annotation
three parameters are required:

\itemize{
\item{\code{distance}: The distance from the border of the image annotation to
the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening is conducted. Unit
of the distance is pixel as is the unit of the image.
}
\item{\code{binwidth}: The width of every bin. Unit is pixel.}
\item{\code{n_bins_circle}: The number of bins that are created.}
}

Regarding parameter \code{n_bins_circle}: The suffix \code{_circle} is used for one
thing to emphasize that bins are created in a circular fashion around the image
annotation (although the shape of the polygon that was created to encircle the
image annotation is maintained). Additionally, the suffix is needed to delineate
it from argument \code{n_bins_angle} which can be used to increase the
resolution of the screening.

These three parameters stand in the following relation to each other:

\enumerate{
\item{\code{n_bins_circle} = \code{distance} / \code{binwidth}}
\item{\code{distance} = \code{n_bins_circle} * \code{binwidth}}
\item{\code{binwidth} = \code{distance} / \code{n_bins_circle}}
}

Therefore, only two of the three arguments must be specified as the remaining
one is calculated. We recommend to stick to the first option: Specifying
\code{distance} and \code{binwidth} and letting the function calculate
\code{n_bins_circle}.

Once the parameters are set and calculated the polygon that is used to
define the borders of the image annotation (the one you draw with
\code{createImageAnnotation()}) is repeatedly expanded by the distance indicated
by parameter \code{binwidth}. The number of times this expansion is
repeated is equal to the parameter \code{n_bins_circle}. Every time the
polygon is expanded, the newly enclosed barcode-spots are binned (grouped)
and the bin is given a number that is equal to the number of the expansion.
Thus, barcode-spots that are adjacent to the image annotation are binned into
bin 1, barcode spots that lie a distance of \code{binwidth} away are binned into
bin 2, etc.

Note that the function \code{plotSurfaceIas()} allows to visually check
if your input results in the desired screening.

\bold{How the screening works:} For every gene that is included in the
screening process every bin's mean expression is calculated and then
aligned in an ascending order - mean expression of bin 1, mean expression
of bin 2, ... up to the last bin, namely the bin with the barcode-spots that lie
farest away from the image annotation. This allows to infer
the gene expression changes in relation to the image annotation and
to screen for genes whose expression changes resemble specific biological
behaviors. The gene expression change is fitted to every model that is included.
(Use \code{showModels()} to visualize the predefined models of \code{SPATA2}).
A gene-model-fit is evaluated twofold:

\itemize{
\item{Residuals area over the curve}: The area under the curve (AUC) of the
residuals between the inferred expression changes and the model is calculated,
normalized against the number of bins and then subtracted from 1.
\item{Pearson correlation}: The inferred expression changes is correlated
with the model. (Correlation as well as the corresponding p-value depend
on the number of bins!)
}

Eventually, the mean of the RAOC and the Correlation for every gene-model-fit
is calculated and stored as the IAS-Score.
