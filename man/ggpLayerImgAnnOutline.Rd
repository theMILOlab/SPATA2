\usage{
ggpLayerImgAnnBorder(...)

ggpLayerImgAnnOutline(
  object = "object",
  ids = NULL,
  tags = NULL,
  test = "any",
  alpha = 0.5,

\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{ids}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, specifies the IDs
of the image annotations of interest. If numeric, the image annotations are picked by number.
If \code{NULL}, all image annotations are included - subsequent selection with \code{tags} and
\code{test} is possible.}

\item{tags}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, the tags for the image annotation
selection. See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{test}{Character value. One of \emph{any}. \emph{all}, \emph{identical}, \emph{not_identical} and
\emph{none}. Specifies how input for \code{tags} is used to select image annotations.
See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{alpha, fill, size, }{Numeric values. Given to \code{ggplot2::geom_polygon()}.}

\item{inner}{Logical value. If \code{FALSE}, only outer borders of the image annotation
are displayed.}
}
\value{
\code{ggpLayer*()}-functions return lists of \code{ggproto} objects
that can be added to ggplots via the \code{+} operator. In most of the cases
they are supposed to be added to plots created with the \code{plotSurface*()}
family.
}
\description{
Adds ggplot2 layer of polygons of structures that were annotated within the image
with \code{createImageAnnotations()}.
}
\note{
Adds two additional layers to set the scales for the color- and
fill aesthetic of the plot.
