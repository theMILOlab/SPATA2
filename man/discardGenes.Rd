\usage{
discardGenes(
  object,
  genes = NULL,
  regex = NULL,
  include_dea = TRUE,
  verbose = NULL,
  of_sample = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{genes}{Character vector or NULL. If character vector, specifies the genes
to be discarded by name.}

\item{regex}{Character value or NULL. If character value, specifies the
regular expression according to which genes are discarded.}

\item{include_dea}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the results of de-analysis
are included. If set to FALSE de-analysis results are skipped during the
discarding steps.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{of_sample}{This argument is currently inactive. It might be reactivated when
spata-objects can store more than one sample.}
}
\value{
An updated spata-object.
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of genes or
a regular expression and discards genes from the object's
data matrices, gene meta data.frames and de-analysis results
that match the input.
