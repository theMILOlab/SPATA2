\title{Add image annotations}
\usage{
addImageAnnotation(object, tags, area, id = NULL)

createImageAnnotations(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{tags}{Character vector or \code{NULL}. If character, the tags for the image annotation
selection. See section \emph{Selection of image annotation with tags} for more information.}

\item{area}{A named list of data.frames with the numeric variables \emph{x} and \emph{y}.
Observations correspond to the vertices of the polygons that are needed to represent the
image annotation. \strong{Must} contain a slot named \emph{outer} which sets the outer border
of the image annotation. \strong{Can} contain multiple slots named \emph{inner} (suffixed)
with numbers that correspond to inner polygons - holes within the annotation. If so,
slot @mode should be \emph{'Complex'}.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}
}
\value{
The input \code{spata2} object containing the added or computed
results.
}
\description{
Functions to add image annotations the \code{SPATA2} object. For
interactive drawing use \code{createImageAnnotaions()}. To set them with code
use \code{addImageAnnotation()}.

Not to confuse with \code{createSegmentation()}.
}
\note{
The interface allows to zoom in on the sample. This is useful if your
spata object contains an HE-image as background and you want to classify
barcode spots based on the histology. As these images are displayed by pixels
the resolution decreases the more you zoom in. Many experiments (such as
the Visium output) contain high resolution images. You can use the function
\code{exchangeImage()} to read in images of higher resolution for a better
histological classification.
