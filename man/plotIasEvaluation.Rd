\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{id}{Character value. The ID of the image annotation of interest.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. All numeric variables (meaning genes,
gene-sets and numeric features) that are supposed to be included in
the screening process.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
image annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the circular bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = getCCD(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value or vector of length 2. Specifies how many times the area is buffered with the value
denoted in \code{binwidth}.
(See details for more.)}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the image annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{model_subset}{Character value. Used as a regex to subset models.
Use \code{validModelNames()} to obtain all model names that are known to \code{SPATA2}
and \code{showModels()} to visualize them.}

\item{model_remove}{Character value. Used as a regex to remove models
are not supposed to be included.}

\item{model_add}{Named list. Every slot in the list must be either a formula
containing a function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns a numeric
vector with the same length as its input vector. Or a numeric vector with the
same length as the input vector. Test models with \code{showModels()}.}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric value. Specifies the degree of transparency of all points.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the size of all points.}

\item{line_alpha}{Numeric. Affects alpha of main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_color}{Character. Affects color of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{line_size}{Numeric. Affects size of the main lines of the plot.}

\item{display_corr}{Logical. If TRUE, correlation values are added to the plots.}

\item{corr_p_min}{Numeric value. Everything below is displayed as \emph{<corr_p_min}.}

\item{corr_pos_x, corr_pos_y}{Numeric vector of length two. The position of
the correlation text with x- and y-coordinates.}

\item{corr_text_sep}{Character value used to separate correlation value and
corresponding p-value.}

\item{corr_text_size}{Numeric value. Size of text.}

\item{force_grid}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE}, \code{facet_grid()} is used regardless
of \code{variables} being of length 1.}

\item{bcsp_exclude}{Character value containing name(s) of barcode-spots to be excluded from the analysis.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

Plots inferred gene expression along the distance to an image
annotation against model values.

\section{Distance measures}{


Several functions in \code{SPATA2} have arguments that take \emph{distance input}.
To specifically refer to a distance the unit must be specified. There are
three ways to create valid input for these arguments.

\strong{1. In pixel:}

There are two valid input options to specify the distance in pixel:

\itemize{
\item{numeric:}{ Single numeric values, e.g. \code{arg_input = c(2, 3.554, 69, 100.67)}. If no unit
is specified the input will be interpreted as pixels.}
\item{character:}{ Suffixed with \emph{'px'}, e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2px', '3.554px', '69px', '100.67px')}}
}

Note: The unit pixel (px) is used for distances as well as for areas. If pixel
refers to a distance the pixel side length is meant. If pixel refers to an area the
number of pixels is meant.

\strong{2. According to the Systeme international d`unites (SI):}

Specifying distances in SI units e.g. \code{arg_input = c('2mm', '4mm')} etc.
requires the input to be a character as the unit must be provided as suffix.
Between the numeric value and the unit must be no empty space! Valid suffixes
can be obtained using the function \code{validUnitsOfLengthSI()}.

\strong{3. As vectors of class \code{unit}:}

Behind the scenes \code{SPATA2} works with the \code{units} package. Input
is converted into vectors of class \code{units}. Therefore, input can be directly
provided this way: \code{arg_input = units::set_unit(x = c(2,4), value = 'mm')}
Note that \emph{pixel} is not a valid unit in the \code{units} package. If you want
to specify the input in pixel you have to use input option 1. In pixel.
