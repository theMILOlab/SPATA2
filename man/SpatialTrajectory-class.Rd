\title{The \code{SpatialTrajectory} - Class}
\description{
Extension of the \code{Trajectory} for trajectories
that have been drawn on a surface plot.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{comment}}{character. A comment about why the trajectory was drawn.}

\item{\code{coords}}{data.frame. The coordinates data.frame of the sample.}

\item{\code{id}}{character. ID that uniquely identfies the trajectory in a sample.}

\item{\code{info}}{list. Stores meta data and miscellaneous information regarding the
image annotation. Slots that should always exist:
\itemize{
\item{current_dim:}{ Numeric vector of length two. Width and height of the image
the @area data.frame is currently scaled to. Used to scale the @area data.frame
if the image annotation is extracted and added to a \code{SPATA2} object with different image resolution.}
\item{current_just:}{ List of two slots that track justification changes. Is used to readjust the
@area data.frame if the image annotation is extracted and added to a \code{SPATA2} object with
different justifications.
\itemize{
\item{\emph{angle}:}{ Numeric value that ranges from 0-359.}
\item{\emph{flipped}:}{ List of two logical values named \emph{horizontal} and \emph{vertical}.}
}}
}}

\item{\code{projection}}{data.frame. Data.frame that contains the length of the
projection of each barcode spot onto the trajectory.}

\item{\code{sample}}{character. The sample name.}

\item{\code{segment}}{data.frame. Contains the course of the trajetory in
form of a data.frame with the variables \emph{x, y, xend} and \emph{yend.}}

\item{\code{width}}{numeric. The width of the rectangle that was spanned along
the trajectory. (Length of the rectangle corresponds to the length of
the segment.)}

\item{\code{with_unit}}{character. The unit in which the width was specified.}
