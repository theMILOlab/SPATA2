\usage{
asGiotto(object, transfer_features = TRUE, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{SPATA2}.}

\item{transfer_features, transfer_meta_data}{Logical or character. Specifies
if meta/feature, e.g clustering, data from the input object is transferred
to the output object. If TRUE, all variables of the feature/meta data.frame
are transferred. If character, named variables are transferred. If FALSE,
none are transferred.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{Giotto}.
}
\description{
Transforms an \code{SPATA2} object to an object of class
 \code{Giotto}. See details for more information.
}
\details{
The object is created using the count matrix of the input as
well as coordinates. If an image is found it is transferred, too. \bold{No}
further processing is done (e.g. \code{Giotto::normalizeGiotto()},
\code{Giotto::runPCA()}).
