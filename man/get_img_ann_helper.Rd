\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{id}{Character value. The ID of the image annotation of interest.}

\item{distance}{Distance value. Specifies the distance from the border of the
image annotation to the \emph{horizon} in the periphery up to which the screening
is conducted. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value or vector of length 2. Specifies how many times the area is buffered with the value
denoted in \code{binwidth}.
(See details for more.)}

\item{binwidth}{Distance value. The width of the circular bins to which
the barcode-spots are assigned. We recommend to set it equal to the center-center
distance: \code{binwidth = getCCD(object)}. (See details for more.) - See details of \code{?is_dist} for more
information about distance values.}

\item{angle_span}{Numeric vector of length 2. Confines the area screened by
an angle span relative to the center of the image annotation.
(See details fore more.)}

\item{n_bins_angle}{Numeric value. Number of bins that are created by angle.
(See details for more.)}

\item{variables}{Character vector. All numeric variables (meaning genes,
gene-sets and numeric features) that are supposed to be included in
the screening process.}

\item{method_gs}{Character value. The method according to which gene sets will
be handled specified as a character of length one. This can be either 'mean
or one of 'gsva', 'ssgsea', 'zscore', or 'plage'. The latter four will be given to gsva::GSVA().}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Either \emph{'mean'} or \emph{'median'}.
Specifies the function with which the bins are summarized.}

\item{normalize_by}{Character value or FALSE. If character, there are two options:
\itemize{
\item{\code{normalize_by} = \emph{'sample'}:}{ Values are normalized across the whole sample.}
\item{\code{normalize_by} = \emph{'bins_angle'}:}{
Values are normalized within each angle bin. This only has an effect if \code{n_bins_angle}
is bigger than 1.
}
}}

\item{normalize}{Logical. If set to TRUE values will be scaled to 0-1.

Hint: Variables that are uniformly expressed can not be scaled and are discarded.}

\item{bcsp_exclude}{Character value containing name(s) of barcode-spots to be excluded from the analysis.}

\item{drop}{Logical value. If TRUE, unused levels of the \emph{bins_circle}
variables are dropped.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}
}
\value{
The final output depends on the input for \code{variables} and
\code{summarize_by}.

By default (both arguments are NULL) the returned data.frame contains
barcode-spots as observations/rows and variables that describe their position
to the image annotation denoted with \code{id}. This includes the variables
\emph{bins_circle}, \emph{bins_order}, \emph{angle}, \emph{bins_angle}. Their
content depends on the set up via the arguments \code{distance}, \code{binwidth}
and \code{n_bins_circle}.

\bold{Coordinates data.frame vs. Inferred expression changes}:

If argument \code{variables} is a character the denoted variables are
joined to the data.frame via \code{joinWith()}. If the set of variables
contains only numeric ones (genes, gene-sets and numeric features) the
function argument \code{summarize_by} can be set up in three different ways:

\itemize{
\item{\code{summarize_by} = \code{FALSE}:}{ Values are not summarized. The output
is a coordinates data.frame with each observation/row corresponding to
a barcode spots with additional information of its relation to the image
annotation denoted in \code{id}.}
\item{\code{summarize_by} = \emph{'bins_circle'}}{ Values of each variable
area summarized by each circular expansion of the polygon. This results
in data.frame with a column named \emph{bins_circle} containing the names of the bin
(\emph{Core, Circle 1, Circle 2, Circle 3, ..., Circle n, Outside}) and 1 column
per variable that contain the summarized expression value by circle bin. Visualization
of the concept can be obtained using \code{plotIasLineplot(..., facet_by = 'variables')}
}
\item{\code{summarize_by} = \emph{c('bins_circle', 'bins_angle'))}}{ Values of
each area are summarized by each circular expansion as well as by angle-bin.
Output data.frame is similar to \code{summarize_by} = \emph{'bins_circle'} apart
from having an extra column identifying the angle-bins. Adding \emph{'bins_circle'}
is only useful if \code{n_bins_circle} is bigger than 1. Visualization
of the concept can be obtained by using \code{plotIasLineplot(..., facet_by = 'bins_angle')}.
}}

Normalization in case of \code{normalize_by} != \code{FALSE} happens after the
summary step.
