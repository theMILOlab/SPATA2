\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid spata-object.}

\item{use_cds_file}{A directory leading to a .rds file containing a valid
cell_data_set-object previously calculated for the specified object. Specified
as a character value. If set to FALSE the cell_data_set object will be created
from scratch.}

\item{save_cds_file}{A filename/directory (that does not already exists) under which the used or created cell_data_set-object
is going to be stored specified as a character value. Should end with .rds.}

\item{preprocess_method}{Given to \code{monocle3::preprocess_cds()} if \code{use_cds_file} isn't a character string.}

\item{cluster_method}{Given to \code{monocle3::cluster_cells()} if \code{use_cds_file} isn't a character string.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to \code{monocle3::plot_cells()}.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of one or two ggplot-objects that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.

\itemize{
\item{\emph{pseudotime}: Monocle3-Umap colored by feature 'pseudotime'. }
\item{\emph{\code{color_to}}: Monocle3-Umap colored by input of \code{color_to}. (if specified)}
