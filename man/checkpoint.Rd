\arguments{
\item{evaluate}{A vector of logical tests to be evaluated.}

\item{case_false}{A character string indicating the message to be displayed if one element of
\code{evaluate} turns out to be FALSE. Needs to be in \code{base::names(\code{error/warning_notifiations})}.}

\item{error_notifications}{A named list of character strings.}

\item{warning_notifications}{A named list of character strings.}

\item{duration}{The duration the message is displayed.}

\item{stop_process, stop_app}{Logical. What is supposed to happen if one element of \code{evaluate}
turns out to be FALSE.}

\value{
A shiny notification.
}
\description{
Wrapper around \code{shiny::req()} and \code{shiny::showNotification()}.
Prevents application from crashing and displays guiding message about what the user
is supposed to do in order to continue without this message to appear.
