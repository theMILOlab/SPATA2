plotBarchart(
  object,
  grouping_variables,
  across = NULL,
  across_subset = NULL,
  relevel = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{across}{Character value or NULL. Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingOptions()} to obtain all variable names that group the
barcode spots of your object in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the particular groups
of interest the grouping variable specified in argument \code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{relevel}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the input order of \code{across_subset}
determines the order in which the groups of interest are displayed. Groups that
are not included are dropped which affects the colors with which they are displayed.}

\item{clrp}{Character value. Specifies the color palette to be used to represent
groups of discrete variables. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to obtain valid
input options.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{display_facets}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the plot is split via
\code{ggplot2::facet_wrap()} such that each variable gets it's own subplot.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Numeric values or NULL. Used to arrange multiple plots.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments given to the respective \code{ggplot2::geom_<plot_type>()}
function. E.g. \code{plotViolinplot()} relies on \code{ggplot2::geom_violin()}.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The discrete features whose group count or
proportion you want to display. Must not contain the feature specified in
\code{across} - if \code{across} is not set to NULL.}
}
\value{
Returns a ggplot-object that can be additionally customized according
to the rules of the ggplot2-framework.
}
\description{
Visualizes the count or the proportion of barcode spots falling
into certain groups via barcharts. It does so either for the whole sample or
in a comparing manner if \code{across} is specified.
