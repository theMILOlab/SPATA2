\usage{
joinWithPca(
  object,
  spata_df,
  n_pcs = NULL,
  verbose = NULL,
  force = FALSE,
  of_sample = NA,
  ...
)

joinWithTsne(object, spata_df, verbose = NULL, force = FALSE, of_sample = NA)

joinWithUmap(object, spata_df, verbose = NULL, force = FALSE, of_sample = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A valid spata-object.}

\item{n_pcs}{Numeric value. Denotes the number of principal components to be included.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{force}{Logical. Only relevant if the spata data.frame provided
already contains the variables that would be added with the function.
If set to TRUE, the variables are added anyway.}

\item{of_sample}{The sample(s) of interest specified as a single character value or vector.
If set to \emph{""} (the default) the first sample is chosen.}

\item{...}{Addtional arguments given to \code{dplyr::left_join()}.}
}
\value{
The input data.frame with the additional dimensional reduction
variables
}
\description{
These functions add dimensional reduction results
in form of additional variables to the provided spata data.frame.
}
