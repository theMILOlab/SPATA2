\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{color_by}{The variable to be displayed by color:

\itemize{
\item{ \strong{Gene set} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
\item{ \strong{Genes} as a character vector. If more than one gene is specified the average
expression of those genes will be calculated and displayed. Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
\item{ \strong{Feature} as a single character value. Must be in \code{getFeaturenNames()}}
}}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric value. Specifies the degree of transparency of all points.}

\item{pt_clrp}{The color palette to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is categorical/discrete. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to see valid input.}

\item{pt_clrsp}{The color spectrum to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is continuous. Run \code{validColorSpectra()} to see valid input.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the size of all points.}

\item{clrp_adjust}{Named character vector or NULL. If character, it adjusts the
color palette that is used to represent the groups. Names of the input vector must refer
to the group and the respective named element denotes the color with which to
represent the group.}

\item{smooth}{Logical. If TRUE, a loess fit is used to smooth the values.}

\item{smooth_span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing.
Given to argument \code{span} of \code{stats::loess()}.}

\item{display_image}{Logical. If set to TRUE the histology image of the specified sample
is displayed underneath the plot.}

\item{xrange, yrange}{Vector of length two or \code{NULL}. If not \code{NULL},
specifies the x- and y-range to which the output image is cropped. E.g.
\code{xrange = c(200, 500)} results in the image being cropped from
x-coordinate 200px up to x-coordinate 500px. If \code{NULL}, the original image
ranges are taken.

This argument works within the \code{SPATA2} distance framework.
If values are specified in European units of length the input is
immediately converted to pixel units. See info section \emph{Distance measures}
for more information.}

\item{expand}{Specifies image expansion. An image that is cropped based on an image
annotation centers around the image annotation. If \code{expand = 0}, the default, the dimensions of the image,
that is width/x-axis and height/y-axis, are set to include only the image annotation area
and nothing more. Using \code{expand}, the cropped image section can be adjusted. See section
\emph{Expansion of cropped image sections} for more information.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}
}
\value{
Plots right into the plotting window.

\description{
Uses Rs base plotting device instead of ggplot2. This
is usually faster but can not make use of the mechanism ggplot2 offers.
