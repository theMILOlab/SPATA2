\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{across}{Character value or NULL. Specifies the grouping variable of interest.

Use \code{getGroupingOptions()} to obtain all variable names that group the
barcode spots of your object in a certain manner.}

\item{across_subset}{Character vector or NULL. Specifies the particular groups
of interest the grouping variable specified in argument \code{across} contains.

If set to NULL all of them are chosen. You can prefix groups you are NOT interested in
with a \emph{'-'}. (Saves writing if there are more groups you are interested in
than groups you are not interested in.)

Use \code{getGroupNames()} to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{relevel}{Logical value. If set to TRUE the input order of \code{across_subset}
determines the order in which the groups of interest are displayed. Groups that
are not included are dropped which affects the colors with which they are displayed.}

\item{method_de}{Character value. Denotes the method to according to which the de-analysis is performed.
Given to argument \code{test.use} of the \code{Seurat::FindAllMarkers()}-function. Run \code{SPATA::dea_methods}
to obtain all valid input options.}

\item{by_group}{Logical value. If TRUE for every group in the grouping
variable a single dot plot is created. If FALSE one plot for all groups and all
gene sets is created.}

\item{genes}{Character vector or NULL. If character, vector of gene names
that determines which genes are included. If NULL, genes are taken according
to the threshold input for average log fold change and adjusted p-value.}

\item{pt_alpha}{Numeric value. Specifies the degree of transparency of all points.}

\item{pt_size}{Numeric value. Specifies the size of all points.}

\item{pt_clrp}{The color palette to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is categorical/discrete. Run \code{validColorPalettes()} to see valid input.}

\item{pt_clrsp}{The color spectrum to be used if the specified variable displayed by
color is continuous. Run \code{validColorSpectra()} to see valid input.}

\item{nrow, ncol}{Numeric values or NULL. Used to arrange multiple plots.}

\item{transform_with}{List or NULL. If list, can be used to transform continuous variables before plotting.
Names of the list slots refer to the variable. The content of the slot refers to the transforming functions.
Slot content can either be a character vector of function names. Use \code{validScaleTransformations()} to obtain all valid character value inputs.
Or it can be a list of functions (and function names).

Useful if you want to apply more than one transformation on variables mapped to
plotting aesthetics. Input for \code{transform_with} is applied before the
respective \code{<aes>_trans} argument.}

\item{...}{Used to absorb deprecated arguments or functions.}

\item{x}{Character value. Specifies what is plotted on the x-axis.
If \emph{p_val_adj} the scale is reversed. Ignored if \code{by_group} = FALSE.}
}
\value{
A ggplot.
