\usage{
getImageSectionsByBarcode(object, barcodes = NULL, expand = 0, verbose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{spata2}.}

\item{barcodes}{Characte vector or NULL. If character, subsets the barcodes
of interest. If NULL, all barcodes are considered.}

\item{expand}{Specifies image expansion. An image that is cropped based on an image
annotation centers around the image annotation. If \code{expand = 0}, the default, the dimensions of the image,
that is width/x-axis and height/y-axis, are set to include only the image annotation area
and nothing more. Using \code{expand}, the cropped image section can be adjusted. See section
\emph{Expansion of cropped image sections} for more information.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If set to TRUE informative messages regarding
the computational progress will be printed.

(Warning messages will always be printed.)}
}
\value{
A named list. Each slot is named after one barcode. The content is
another list that contains the barcode specific image section as well
