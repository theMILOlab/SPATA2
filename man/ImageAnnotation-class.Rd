\title{The \code{ImageAnnotation} - Class}
\description{
S4 class that represents manually annotated structures in
histology images.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{area}}{list. A named list of data.frames with the numeric variables \emph{x} and \emph{y}.
Observations correspond to the vertices of the polygons that are needed to represent the
image annotation. \strong{Must} contain a slot named \emph{outer} which sets the outer border
of the image annotation. \strong{Can} contain multiple slots named \emph{inner} (suffixed)
with numbers that correspond to inner polygons - holes within the annotation. If so,
slot @mode should be \emph{'Complex'}.}

\item{\code{id}}{character. String to identify the object in a list of multiple objects
of the same class.}

\item{\code{image}}{image. Cropped version of the annotated parent image that only contains
the area where the annotated structure is located (plus expand). This slot should
be empty as long as the \code{ImageAnnotation} object is located in an
object of class \code{HistologyImaging}. Extracting it with \code{getImageAnnotation()}
or \code{getImageAnnotations()} can add a cropped image to the slot. The parameters
with which the image was cropped should be in the list of slot @image_info.}

\item{\code{image_info}}{list. List of information around the image that is currently
stored in slot @image after being cropped and set within \code{getImageAnnotation()}
or \code{getImageAnnotations()}.}

\item{\code{info}}{list. Stores meta data and miscellaneous information regarding the
image annotation. Slots that should always exist:
\itemize{
\item{parent_origin:}{ Character string. Content from slot @info$origin of the \code{HistologyImaging}
object the annotation belongs to. Identifies the exact image on which the annotation was drawn in.}
\item{parent_id:}{ Character string. Content from slot @id of the \code{HistologyImaging}
object the annotation belongs to. Identifies the \code{HistologyImaging} object (the tissue) the annotation
belongs to.}
\item{current_dim:}{ Numeric vector of length two. Width and height of the image
the @area data.frame is currently scaled to. Used to scale the @area data.frame
if the image annotation is extracted and added to a \code{SPATA2} object with different image resolution.}
\item{current_just:}{ List of two slots that track justification changes. Is used to readjust the
@area data.frame if the image annotation is extracted and added to a \code{SPATA2} object with
different justifications.
\itemize{
\item{\emph{angle}:}{ Numeric value that ranges from 0-359.}
\item{\emph{flipped}:}{ List of two logical values named \emph{horizontal} and \emph{vertical}.}
}}
}}

\item{\code{misc}}{list. A flexible list for miscellaneous input.}

\item{\code{tags}}{character. Vector of arbitrary length. Contains tags that can be used
to group and select image annotations in different manners.}
}}

\section{Image annotation tags}{

Slot @tags contains a character vector of arbitrary length that allows
to filter image annotations using a combination of arguments \code{tags} and
\code{test} in functions that refer to one or more image annotations like
\code{getImageAnnotations()} or \code{plotImageAnnotations()}.

Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
\enumerate{
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{not_identical} or \emph{4}: To be included, an image
annotation must \strong{not} be tagged with the combination of input tags.
\item Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'none'} or \emph{5}: To be included, an image annotation
must \strong{not} contain any of the input tags.
}

Note that the filtering process happens in addition to / after the filtering by input for argument
\code{ids}.
