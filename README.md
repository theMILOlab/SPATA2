# SPATA2

Welcome to **SPATA2**, a comprehensive toolbox for **Spa**tial **T**ranscriptomics **A**nalysis. For detailed tutorials and examples, please visit our [official documentation](https://themilolab.github.io/SPATA2/).

## Citation

If you have used SPATA2 for your analysis, please consider citing:

- [Kueckelhaus J.\*, Frerich S.\* et al. (2024). *Nat Commun*, 15, 7280.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50904-x)

As SPATA2 relies on some processing functions from Seurat, we also recommend citing [Hao Y. et al. (2024). *Nat Biotechnol*, 42, 293–304](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01767-y).

Additionally, depending on the specific functions you utilize, other citations may be appropriate. For instance, the `runBayesSpaceClustering()` function implements the BayesSpace clustering algorithm: [Zhao E. et al. (2021). *Nat Biotechnol*, 39, 1375–1384](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00935-2).

You can find the necessary references for specific functions in the corresponding documentation, such as `?runBayesSpaceClustering` under the "References" section.
