#' @title The \code{HistologyImaging} - Class
#'
#' @description S4 class that represents a set of histological images from one
#' and the same tissue slide.
#'
#' @slot annotations list. List of objects of class \code{ImageAnnotation}.
#' @slot coordinates data.frame. A data.frame of observational units that underlie
#' the image in case of spatially resolved multi-omic studies. Should contain at least
#' the  two variables: *x*, *y* and a variable that identifies the observational
#' units (e.g. *barcodes*).
#' @slot dir_add list. Named list of directories that contain different versions
#' of tissue images. Can be arbitrarily expanded for convenient exchanging via
#' `loadImage()`.
#' @slot dir_default character. Directory that leads to the default image for save
#' exchanging via `loadDefaultImage()`.
#' @slot dir_highres character. Directory that leads to a high resolution version of the image
#' for save exchanging via `loadHighresImage()`.

#' @slot grid list. That contains information about spatial grids.
#' @slot id character. String to identify the imaged tissue.
#' @slot image Image. Should be compatible with the `EBImage` package.
#' @slot image_info list. Stores meta data and miscellaneous information regarding the
#' image that is currently stored in slot @@image. Slots that should always exist:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{*origin*:}{ Character string. Either the directory from where the current image was read
#'  in or a substitute of the object name that was used from the global environment.}
#'  \item{*dim_input*:}{ The dimensions with which the image was given to argument `image` of
#'  `createHistologyImaging()` or `exchangeImage()`.}
#'  \item{*dim_stored*:}{ The dimensions with which the image is currently stored.}
#'  \item{*img_scale_fct*:}{ The scale factor input that was used to resize the current image within
#'  `createHistologyImaging()` or `exchangeImage()` before setting it. If 1, *dim_stored* and *dim_input*
#'  should be identical. See argument `scale_fct` of `exchangeImage()` for more details on its interpretation.}
#'   \item{*pxl_scale_fct*:}{ Numeric value that gives the side length of one pixel an SI unit that is stated
#'   in an attribute called *unit* as nSI-units/px.}
#'  }
#' @slot justification list. List of two slots that track justification changes. See corresponding
#' section below the slot descriptions for more information.
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{*angle*:}{ Numeric value that ranges from 0-359.}
#'  \item{*flipped*:}{ List of two logical values named *horizontal* and *vertical*.}
#'  }
#' @slot meta list. List for meta data regarding the tissue.
#' @slot misc list. A flexible list for miscellaneous input.
#'
#' @section Requirements:
#' The `HistologyImaging` framework assumes that all read in images have the same
#' axes-ratio.
#'
#' @section Tracking changes in image justification:
#' The histology image that is used while creating the object is considered the
#' default image. By default, the framework assumes that all related images (high resolution,
#' low resolution, fluorescent images, RAMAN spectroscopy etc.) have the same justification
#' in terms of angle rotation and axes-flipping. Flipping an image in the `SPATA2` object via
#'  `flipImage()` or rotating images via `rotateImage()` changes their justification in space.
#' These changes in justification are tracked (if `track` is not set to `FALSE`) and applied
#' whenever an image is exchanged via `exchangeImage()` (if `adjust` is not set to `FALSE`).
#' This ensures consistent image exchanges using the different directories.

#' Input for argument \code{tags} specifies the tags of interest.
#' Argument \code{test} decides about how the specified tags are used to select
#' the image annotations of interest. There are multiple options:
#'
#' 1. Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'any'} or \emph{1}: To be included, an image annotation
#' must be tagged with at least one of the input tags.
#'
#' 2. Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'all'} or \emph{2}: To be included, an image annotation
#' must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can contain tags that are not specified.
#'
#' 3. Argument \code{test} set to \emph{'identical'} or \emph{3}: To be included, an image annotation
#' must be tagged with all of the input tags. Can not be tagged with anything else.
#'
#' 4. Argument `test` set to *not_identical* or *4*: To be included, an image
#' annotation must **not** be tagged with the combination of input tags.
#'
#' 5. Argument `test` set to *'none'* or *5*: To be included, an image annotation
#' must **not** contain any of the input tags.
